# django-svelte-ecommerce-starter
cookie cutter template for django and sveltekit
---

This template builds on django as a backend using Django rest framework, and sveltekit as the frontend for the admin dashboard

Some features include
- Accounts management from the frontend
- Multiple user types (with object level permissions coming soon, hopefully)
- An API for any frontend to consume, Or optionaly you can build on top of the existing sveltekit application
- Built on a rest API, GraphQL is in the works
- Beautiful dashboard design using [TailwindUi](https://tailwindui.com)

keep in mind at this point this is still in development, check back for updaes or reach out to me for help
